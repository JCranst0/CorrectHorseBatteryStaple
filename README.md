# CorrectHorseBatteryStaple
A password generator based on XKCD #936.

## Introduction
This is a relatively simple password generator. I created it as part of my work on teaching myself Python as a tool I will actually use. It's built on the idea that a password like "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple" is easier to remember and more secure than a password like "Tr0ub4dor&3". It's also, ideally, easier and faster for a general user than a password that is a randomized string of numbers and letters. The list of words to draw from, stored in words_list.txt is now over 1000 words long and produces passwords with an average length of 25-26 characters without tha additional, optional characters.

## Technologies
The entire body of the code is written using Python 3.8.

## Launch
Store words_list.txt and password_generator.py in the same directory. Run in a Terminal Session or through PyCharm.
